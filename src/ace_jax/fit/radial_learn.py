"""Learned tensor-basis radials by variable projection (VarPro).

The optimiser moves the analytic-branch mixing weights Wnlq; the linear readout
is projected out exactly.  At fixed hyperparameters theta the projected ridge
residual

    r(W) = min_c ||Phi(W) c - y||^2_w + c^T Lambda c = yy - b^T (G + Lambda)^{-1} b,
    Lambda = diag(gamma^2 / sigma_c^2),

is closed form in the streamed linear statistics (G, b, yy) of the model with
radials W, so no design matrix is ever materialised.  Its W-gradient is the
exact Golub-Pereyra/Kaufman gradient (envelope theorem), taken by autodiff
through the checkpointed `linear_statistics` scan.  M = 0 throughout: the
residual GP is fitted afterwards on the frozen learned model.
